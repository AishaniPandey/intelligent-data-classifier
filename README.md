Intelligent Data Classifier
Overview
The Intelligent Data Classifier is a robust machine learning model using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Decision Trees to perform multi-label classification. This project demonstrates the application of fundamental algorithms developed from scratch, aimed at achieving high accuracy in complex label prediction tasks through meticulous hyperparameter tuning.

Features
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Custom implementation of the KNN algorithm, allowing for adjustable parameters such as the number of neighbors and distance metrics.
Decision Trees: Utilizes both Powerset and MultiOutput formulations to address complex classification scenarios.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Detailed optimization process to enhance model performance.
Data Analysis: Extensive exploratory data analysis with visualizations to understand data distributions and relationships.
